### React Native Snippet:
Search starting with `rn`, vs-code will suggest

`rnfe` => import React Native, Elements, Dummy `View` placeholder functional component and export. `rnfes` will put `StyleSheet.create({})`

Search starting with `im` for importing. 
`imrn` for react native and `imrc` for react specif modules

Styling Template For React Native => `rnss` for `const styles = StyleSheet.create({});`
